# MQT QMAP - A Tool for Mapping Quantum Circuits onto various Hardware Technologies

```{raw} latex
\begin{abstract}
```

MQT QMAP is an open-source C++20 and Python library for mapping quantum circuits onto various hardware technologies developed as part of the _{doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>`_.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the MQT QMAP library, including {doc}`installation instructions <installation>`, demo notebooks, and detailed {doc}`API documentation <api/mqt/qmap/index>`.
The source code of MQT QMAP is publicly available on GitHub at [munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap), while pre-built binaries are available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qmap/) for all major operating systems and all modern Python versions.
MQT QMAP is fully compatible with Qiskit 1.0 and above.

We recommend you to start with the {doc}`installation instructions <installation>` or by reading our overview paper {cite:p}`wille2023qmap`.
Then proceed to the {doc}`mapping page <mapping>`, the {doc}`synthesis/optimization page <synthesis>`, the {doc}`neutral atom state preparation page <na_state_prep>`, or the {doc}`zoned neutral atom compiler <na_zoned_compiler>`, and read the {doc}`reference documentation <api/mqt/qmap/index>`.
If you are interested in the theory behind MQT QMAP, have a look at the publications in the {doc}`publication list <references>`.

We appreciate any feedback and contributions to the project. If you want to contribute, you can find more information in the {doc}`Contribution <contributing>` guide.
If you are having trouble with the installation or the usage of MQT QMAP, please let us know at our {doc}`Support <support>` page or by reaching out to us at [quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de](mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de).
